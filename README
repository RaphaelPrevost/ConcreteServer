=============================

Description
===========

    Concrete Server is a server framework, providing all the necessary
building blocks to design and implement efficient TCP or UDP services.

    The scope of this framework is not limited to networking functionalities,
it also provides a database access API, a string library, and a plugin system
to host different services on top of the Concrete Server.

    The Concrete Server can be either embedded, by linking to the Concrete
Server Framework Library and implementing a builtin plugin, or extended, by
using the Concrete Server with a custom external plugin.

Requirements
============

    Concrete Server should compile and run on most POSIX-compliant operating
systems providing POSIX threads support and the GNU C Compiler.

    Concrete Server can also compile and run on Microsoft Windows 2000 and
above.

Installation
============

    * POSIX-compliant Operating Systems (GNU/Linux, Mac OS X)
      -------------------------------------------------------

    To compile the Concrete Server Framework Library, the Concrete Server and
    the shipped plugins, simply run the following command:

        make -j3

    If you need to rebuild it, please run the following command first:

        make clean

    Once the compilation is over, you can run the server in interactive mode
    with this command:

        LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./concrete

    Or start it as a daemon:

        LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./concrete -d

    Don't hesitate to see the different options available, using:

        LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ./concrete --help

    * Microsoft Windows 2000 and above
      --------------------------------

    To compile the Concrete Server Framework Library, the Concrete Server and
    the shipped plugins, you will need to use the free Dev-C++ development
    environment available at this address:

        http://www.bloodshed.net/devcpp.html

    Once Dev-C++ is installed and working, just go to the folder win32/ and
    compile the libconcrete.dev project, then the ConcreteServer.dev
    project.

    The projects come with the required dynamic link libraries, which are
    freely redistributable.

    You can run Concrete Server in interactive mode with this command:

        ConcreteServer.exe

    You can also install it as an NT Service using:

        ConcreteServer.exe /i

    and uninstall it with:

        ConcreteServer.exe /u

    Don't hesitate to see the different options available using:

        ConcreteServer.exe /h
