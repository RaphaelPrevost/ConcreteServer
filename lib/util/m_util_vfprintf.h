 * @param buffer the buffer to output data into
 * @param size size of the buffer
 * @param fmt0 format
 * @param ap variable argument list
 * @return the size in bytes of the resulting formatted string
 *
 * This modified printf function is based upon the original
 * printf of the OpenBSD libc.
 *
 * The printf behaviour has been slightly modified to suits
 * the needs of this software. Now, passing a NULL output
 * buffer is allowed; in this case, @ref m_vsnprintf()
 * will simply return the number of bytes which would have
 * been written. Some extensions to write binary data have
 * also been added to the original formatting convention.
 *
 * Additionnally, the %url flag allows to print an urlencoded
 * string.
 *
 * The number of bytes written does not include the terminal NUL.
 *
 * To write binary data, it is required to add the 'b' flag to the
 * format string. Using the 'b' flag alone implies using the
 * system endianness.
 *
 * However, the binary data endianness may be enforced using
 * the bB (big endian) or bb (little endian) combinations.
 * If the enforced endianness matches the system endianness,
 * nothing special will be done, but otherwise the data will
 * be swapped.
 *
 * e.g: you want to write a big endian integer, on a
 * little endian machine:
 *
 * snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "%bBi", i);
 * raw data written in 'buf' (big endian seen by little endian):
 * 0xEFBEADDE
 * data originally stored in 'i' (little endian):
 * 0xDEADBEEF
 *
 * It is also possible to force the binary data size, using the
 * classical field width syntax '*'.
 *
 * This said, forcing the type width only works 'as expected'
 * with *complete* binary types of the forced length. It will
 * indeed write the n lower or higher bytes of a wider type
 * depending on the system endianness (swapped if another endianness
 * was enforced).
 * So, if you want to truncate a wider data type, you should use the
 * t/T (or tL/tH) flags to reliably write its lower/higher bytes.
 *
 * NB: The binary data type is still mandatory (dioux).
 *
 * So, it is correct to use the formats :
 * %3bBti to write the 24 lower bits of a big endian integer
 * %3bBi writes a 24 bits big endian integer just fine
 * %4bbTlli writes the higher 32 bits of a little endian long long
 * %bi writes an integer of system width and endianness
 * but the next are not valid or dangerous formats :
 * %3bBt invalid (missing type)
 * %2bi (it will write the lower/higher two bytes of data depending
 *      on the system endianness, and the data are assumed to use
 *      the system endianness -- it may be perfectly fine, if that
 *      was the intented purpose)
